:Info: A collection of useful/interesting code snippets and notes
:Authors: Steve Challis (http://schallis.com)
:Requires: Incurable curiosity

It is often useful to keep code snippets and instructions whenever you solve a
problem, particularly if the details were important. This `org-mode
<http://orgmode.org/>`_ file is a collection of such pieces of code that have
been and will continue to be collected over a period of years in a systems
administration and software development context.

It is my hope that this file will evolve and provoke discussion as it is
shared so that it may enhance the toolbox of whomever chooses to read it.

Whilst this file can be enjoyed and edited using any text editor, a suitable
Emacs setup will expose all interactive elements and enhance its usefulness.
